#### Vanilla-Fluidbox

A drop-in replacement (except event emitters, missing for now), of [Fluidbox](http://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/demo/index.html) written in vanilla JS. The only dependency is [lodash/debounce](https://bundlephobia.com/package/lodash.debounce@4.0.8).

It migth be written as a package in the future, for now I used it directly as a JS file in my personal website.
